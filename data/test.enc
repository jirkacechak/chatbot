It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
What is FR ? Does n't the club have different levels for different swimmers ?
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
All right, I will, I will.

Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.

Is it just me or does Curry put a lil extra on his shot
They're ready for you, sir.

I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.

Melee to PM makes everything soooo much easier . Pm to Melee and I cant do anything .
Everyone knows what happened , the colonists got turned into zombies .
Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?
The kind that takes half a second before one of them died , like a rock was thrown rather than a bullet shot ?
I have n't considered this as an exclusive option , no .

No I do not . Until today I have n't had a need to use it in a sentence on my phone .
I 'm not shovelling until it stops snowing
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the  only  one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I  understand you .
You're taking this too far, Drew.
Yeah . Idk if I can overcome anxiety . I atleast need meds for that I 'm realizing .

That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
Well, I want you to leave.

Right.
Did he ask for money or not ?
That supports my argument that Brevik 's actions were politically motivated . He did n't want to impose religion , he wanted to prevent religion from being imposed .
We'll see when we get home okay.
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.
You're lying, aren't you?
Would n't surprise me to see Joe Harris get traded . He really is n't needed anymore , and Denver might like his potential .

Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better �� to improve upon what was already done.
Oh, that's too bad.
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
He 's got a good point . Joe Flacco is tied with Trent Dilfer in Super Bowl wins .

Second verse!
You're talking about real excitement?
You lost your control.
Why not get BS weapons ? Quality of the weapons being traded up has no impact on the quality of the result item
Last night was quite a romp.
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.

This is Wednesday.
No salsa , tomato , lettuce , zucchini ? And cool ranch , yuck !

One that fits . Helmets are a pretty bad thing to buy online because different models are shaped differently and everyone has a different head .
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
One size totally does fit all . You can for your entire arm in a standard condom

Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
I do n't want to have people with your bullshit client in the game .
My bad . I apologize for ruining your optimism .
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am.
I insist.
What do you mean?
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed
How long?

Is Butler usually this bad , or is the weather effecting his punts ?
What can I be doing for you?
The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.

Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
What?
I 've signed up having meant to for a while - does anyone know how long it takes to get approved ?
I'm already free...
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.

It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
Do you hate people who play games ?
"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
Then who are they?
No , but it was the only one I could think of at the time . Possibly fervor or zeal ?

I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
I do it all the time!
I never did complete Superion when I was a kid ... My son will get one !
How long do you have to go?
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
Then tell me how.
I got it.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!

Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brother�s death.

So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.
The first year is so good , but I 'm really looking forward to seeing Death 's son get further into the storyline . He 's going to be very cool .
All I have to do is call the guards.
I just ca n't imagine being in a relationship without any attraction . I just ca n't get my head around it

Put the fucking kettle down.
It 's not a perfect metaphor , but I think these are useful as a baseline .

Do you believe him?
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
oh the pain ! The pain of it all !
As a parent, that's my right
What do you want?
What is the primary compound that your body is formed from ?
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
These stupid fucks responded to a playground with live ammunition instead of the rubber bullets and tasers they have been equipped with . That is where they fucked up .
That 's why it 's a secret that I have n't told anyone in real life .
Pow?
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
Max.
What do you think our chances are?
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
i live in the NoVa area and im half inclined to message the seller and pick these up before you

Father, I have sinned...
What gentleman, Maria?
NY Giants , specializing in embarrassing losses and Super Bowl wins . Sometimes in the same year .
This is pretty much it . There are actually laws in Britain against saying offensive things .
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.
yup , I got in too ! Are you in my group ?
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
I don't care about your sword.
How's she doing?
Have you ever played GTA and followed all traffic rules , just so you could follow and murder anyone you see who did n't use a signal while changing lanes ?

Paid the gunsmith , and my Mauser is on it 's way back to me with a shiny new barrel .
At least use an image showing the awesome late game buildings and units ffs
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
You guys used to work together?
theres no way you could fit your mouth around that
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.

My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
So ... can i tell people my cute little caique parrot is a ferocious dino ?
Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
Do you?
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
She looks just like Mrs. Patricia Handy, a married woman... I useta fool with. Man, I kin sniff blondes from a hunnert yards and redheads from a mile and a half.
Me personally i like red . Its a sexy color on a woman . But not all can pull it off .

Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
Just the missiles.
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
You 're the one who is gay not him , so why do you expect him to understand what being gay is like ?
Yeah . It makes me sad more than it makes me annoyed , though .
Weren't you expecting us?
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.

Zumiez is definitely more widely spread than Washington , but I have n't seen one anywhere on the East Coast . Thanks , great list .
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.

Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going.
That 's not nice .
This is wrong in so many ways.
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.

They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
Can you shake it back into position ?
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
Well if you build a story around a flawed idea it likely does n't work .
That was from Arrested Development but good try .
Haha , this is cute . AutoMod can be whichever gender you want it to be . : p
She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.

They missed out on Jade Jolie 's repetitive laugh that gets used way too much , even Taylor swift pulled out her laugh .

Deadliest Catch was an awesome show you shut your filthy mouth
Pick a ream and start catching their games . You 'll pick it up as you go along .
And then what happened?
How accurate are those calorie counters ? I have one on my treadmill and wonder if I 'm burning remotely close to what it 's telling me .

I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon

Yeah . To be honest a lot of people would be ok with the movie had Clone Wars not set the bar so high !

The picture is a little blurry , but I think she 's fuckable .
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
The stiff one eye?

I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.

Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well.

You WILL go out there.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
Not a great comparison , the dell and lg monitors you linked to both have larger screens .

You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think.

What was he after?
Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
No, Nick, no
Wonder how they would feel if people put up fake cell towers to track the police ? You can bet you would get the full on terrorist treatment .
Are you certain it was stolen and not lost ? In either case , this sucks but it 's not really the place to beg for free games .
You'll forget him, Sugar.
I enjoy Mirtle and Siegel although I would prefer if Mirtle had a little more upbeat or positive tweets every once in a while . Not everything has to be negative .
I remember reading that in sixth grade and having to get permission slip for my parents because It had witchcraft in it . I live in the bible belt .
I still think the editor hated his job and was on his way out . It had to be intentional . No one can mistake that for real life footage .
I never forgot that.
I need to find a way to binge watch it ... and the superman series
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and  we got him .  You there?

You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
Big ups for the Ween album . The Stallion gets me every time .

You flatter me.

Did our feed show him puking ? I did n't see it . Guess for once I 'm happy I missed something while looking at the GDT .
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?

All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?

Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
What is it?
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
I do n't mean to sound rude because she 's gorgeous but this is definitely the least attractive part of her .
I would log out of my account if the game would load .
Had to do this myself . Stop drinking was the advice , along with anti depressants . Still drinking and have taken a grand total of zero pills .
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
As someone who 's working tonight and is missing the episode ... Are Amy , Rosa and Gina in two piece bathing suits in this or just onesies ?
An old flame?
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
Now's a helluva time to play "what if".
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
If he played starter minutes he 'd be rookie of the year , but he does n't . It 's that simple
Anyone have the video available , I 've never believed this image , it looks shopped . But VC does things that do not look real .
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
I...please.  My wife...my wife's prescription has run out.  If I can call him...
Restart your console ? That 's a strange one and sounds like a glitch of some sort .

Fsu 's mistakes are absolutely killing them this game . That fumble and several penalties in the red zone

Oh how I miss Orlando and the themed parties . Great costume and I really like your mask !
Stan Grossman called.
Fucking crow.
K-k-kill somebody?
My point is that there 's no need for the lines . They could have all those paying customers dealt with in a timely fashion . But they chose not to .
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
But it doesnt happen that way , often , when you date a mature person .
The seat in the back and near the window belongs to the MC .
To me? But why?

What is it?
How long was that up on the website ?

There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?

Y'all went to a bcs bowl and won in spectacular fashion multiple times ?
Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.

Because it's in The Big Chill.
This was proven in a post literally yesterday on this sub that that 's not true . They 're just pasties for before she shot the scene .
A plague?

The trek out to the hospital every day didn�t help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
Regardless it was a very generous and extensive giveaway . You ca n't call it stupid that you did n't win and someone more lucky did
Dad, look what I drew.
I lost my cargo too and was unable to connect but after I reconnected , my cargo reappeared . Hopefully the same happened for you !
Miller high life is the champagne of beers .

I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
If I ever decide to include testimonials in my portfolio , I 'm starting with this comment .
Let's see if you've gotten any better.

How do you know this?
Knowing when to speak and , more importantly , when not to speak .
Space needle should give it away . Is that Mt Rainier in the background ?
If you 've been looking for an opportunity to largely agree with Charles Krauthammer , here 's your chance .

I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
Howdy, neighbor.
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
I second this . He is a great developer and I bought all the versions of Springtomize , but sometimes he makes me think that he takes the money and runs .
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
I hate that music.
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
He also did n't tailor his clothes himself or have some epic wildlife photography .

I would assume the orders should have been canceled before the product shipped . In my opinion , letting the product get sold then asking for it back is not legal .
Also if anyone has any recommendations on a bottle of eliquid from them , I got a free voucher for the wait , and am thinking about space jam - astro .
Yeah , we do n't freak out , we just wait impatiently

In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?

Wake me , when you need me .
I might put Luc on it , idk . I 've been looking for a B 's WC jersey for a decent price for a long time .
Not to mention they had Luke look strikingly like the Emperor in that cloak . All dark and badass looking .
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.

I 'll pull up a video of ocean waves to listen to sometimes , sometimes I 'll listen to a guided chakra meditation . Rest of the time just silence .

What have you been doing?
and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
Oh but he 's faking it ! He knows there 's a camera there and he is actually just laughing that he killed a man !
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
He actually does n't have a left arm .
Same here , granted I was in the Navy but I think it 's a symbol of the times more than anything .

If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!

Product MELTING ? As in melted ramen or the cooker ?
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
It bit you.
Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
I saw that ZI post ! Congratulations , guys ! You definitely deserve the recognition .
I disagree with redbull Salzburg , Austrian casual fans like RB Salzburg as they are semi successful in Europe .
I called Dan Koretzky because he

Add a bottom and left sleeve tag for some flair . Either way I 'd cop it .
I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
Lol and the point of that was what ? Until the law is changed they will uphold it . Is that beyond your capacity of understanding ?
Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!
Yeah , this one 's a wee bit dumb . It 's good you can nuke orbital , but you should have to shoot orbital to make it happen .
Your sure as hell right about that.
I've been calling for days!
Such is the way of things . Caron would probably score more in Edmonton as well , by virtue of getting more TOI .
You ripped of a friend ? Or they owed you one ?
Like dancing?
Be honest with yourself mate , you have no idea what you 're talking about .
Link karma is only earned when submitting links . You do n't receive any link karma from self-posts .
Kinda wish they had that for nicotine .
How long?
Yeah?
I assumed the licenses already had a fleg and they removed it , rather than it being a new thing . So a non-issue became an even bigger non-issue .
Where is your farm?
Did you say  Dmitri?  How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
How can I ever thank you?
Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.

I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
How's it hanging, Miles?

He slammed Legend of Korra pretty hard , so not really .
i do n't see many dark skinned characters
That looks awesome . Wish I could snowboard . But I got a bad injury when I was snowboarding since then I 'm scared .

My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
Julia.
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women.
What do you think bodyguards are for?
Would you like some?
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
Wow . Good luck , i know that has to be a terrible feeling .
Unless you want to be a builder , I would recommend waiting .

I 'm taking a Jeep to pull the Mars Rover out . I 'm surprised you did n't see the article on the front page yesterday .
Well said . It 'll be hard keeping Riley out of the squad soon . He 's growing into a fine player .
You thought any more about our murder?
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
Well...
You 're both wrong . Move on .
Reach out and snort someone.
I just picked up Gobert couple days ago . Worth the drop for nurkic ?
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
Seriously? It's a great idea.
Someone sub in Cardale Jones ; Lindley has had enough .
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
How do you know that?
You buy furniture.  You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need.  No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled.  Then, the right set of dishes.  The right dinette.
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
Just fire them all already . A bunch of volunteer citizens that actually give a shit would do a better job anyway .
Then they lost?
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Darn it!
I hope he sells the old version of bad juju this weekend .
Do n't get too carried away with that damn muzzle brake torture device ... Or else it could go off on accident then it would be Two to the Morgue .
That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?
Don't hit that boy no more.
Who sent you to Greece?
Who told you you could sit down here?
Do you know what that is?
It looks intact.
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
Eh ... it 's an throwaway . Probably not even a chick .
Did they botch the original ending to the IC Title match ? Edit : the music botch and Kane coming out of nowhere makes me think yes , they did .
Look at his troop levels . I 'm sure he could n't have pulled it off no matter what lol .
We don't have a maid any more.
I was thinking abba caving would be fun to do
He probably thought that they were the movies

I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
That would be an insanely lucrative publication . That said I think it would be just as disrespectful as the Cobain Diaries thing that Courtney Love published .
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects.
Entirely normal . It 's when you start stalking him and believing you 're his wife ... then there 's a wee problem .
I think Palestinians have a reason to be pissed . They are literally in the world 's largest jail .
That's temporary.
Not to mention what terrorist are as well armed as the swat people
Your Honor, I object.
What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.
My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter.  To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R.  Best friend!

yeah as an american i was a little confused . i 've never heard of or had a sour cherry
Yes , they 're practically relegated , eh ? Broke too ... God , the levels of exaggeration in this thread are stunning .
I 'm not usually doing those things out and about though . I 'm usually at home and have easy access to scissors !
Everyone goes silent . Awkward glances exchanged .
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
Not true : if we killed all Muslims then they would cease to be a problem .
New to long boarding , tell me essential things that I need to know ?
Just get Hochuli in there . He 's not perfect but he 's the best they have .
Edible does not mean palatable though . Some of those plants are kinda icky .
I almost shooped up the alternate condom photo as well .
I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
Yes , but in a very limited Release or not ?
So , does this make gravity drives unnecessary and too complicated for their worth ?
Now they just have to meet the Rooney rule requirements .
It 's time for Europe and the West to take the kiddy gloves off when it comes to Islam and Muslims .
I just have two requests , could you change my Metagross 's nature to Jolly and give my Entei perfect IVs ?
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
You boys carryin' pieces?

Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Thanks for the response . Why is localbitcoin more anonymous ?
Well, I better get going. Hit those stairs again.  Was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him?
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
There is one way . A Simple tax system with a low rate and harsh penalties for cheating .
I 'm checking for a hobo because they are my worst fear and my plan is to just be paralyzed with fear or shit myself and cry .
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.

Lets figure out a time this weekend for me to hook you up
What about Kanita?
good morning, George
That is exactly what I 'm doing . I have my dog and all my reptiles at home so I commute the hour and a half daily .
Well I regretted asking sooner than usual .
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
How to die, mostly.
Good point on the carbs . I forgot I used to eat salami . Some frown on it because of nitrates but I get the fancier dry cured stuff .
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
HEY I 'LL LET YOU GUYS KNOW WHEN MY HEART STOPS POUNDING SOMETIME TOMORROW PROBABLY OK

I 'm not even mad , I had low expectations coming in to this .
I just picture a bunch of orangutans sipping tea .
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
A film case.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
i think thats just someone reposting for karma
On your own time?
The worst part of living in southern Mississippi is hoe religious everyone is and how much they shame those of us who are n't .
Because of supply and demand . There 's more demand for a flight from New York to London , so prices are higher .
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
The problem with Arsenal is they always try to walk it in .
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
Given that the existence of Jesus is somewhat lacking in evidence , I find this difficult to believe .
But you're planning to be?
Do sports require the input of knowledge and mathematics ?
Sorry , but that is n't really a good enough deal on my end .

Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Who?
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
Exactly . You can see why I 'm concerned .
I live in Oklahoma and there are earthquakes , I move to LA and there are tornadoes . What the fuck is going on ? !

V'ger plans to literally  meld  to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
He's better, isn't he?
That's right.
Shadow of Mordor made the Orcs badass and insecure at the same time .
I don't think so.
Rape , so much rape , then maybe go around and play a ghost , and then rape one more time .
I'm cash poor.

The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?

Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.

What are you talking about?
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?

Sure is a hairy fellah.
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
How'd you get the picture?

Patents my friend , you forget them .
wow , that is really bad luck ! Mine has worked for a while now with no complications or breaking parts .

Why not?
Oh , just managed to get in . edit : never mind , just kicked me off again .
Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.
Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you.
Let's do it here.
What?
Korra will see Sozin 's comet , Aang was alive during two of it 's arrivals , and Kyoshi probably saw it twice ; like Bumi and Pathik .
And therefore is no longer a bug , but now an intended feature : P
Sure it is , maybe the reason why so few people are playing HC is that they are sick of losing their characters to circumstances outside their control .
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
Not in the service industry , but my home hospital teacher used to always drink hot water . Not tea . Just boiling hot water . It was gross .
Needs more milk crate seats and fixies mate

You stayin' in or not?
Of course. Shemp is unaware that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over. We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp the trip was instantaneous.

Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
I wish the Luigi amiibo looked like that , haha
What do you mean they will straighten out the nigger problem by then .
The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs
Well aside from myself , because God knows I 'm the most beautiful creature that has ever graced the earth with my existence .
Glad I 'm not the only one who catches that vibe . Also , is she in love with Adnan ? Maybe just a little ?
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.
Can I have anything on this pizza ?
Just think , Pitt 's got this exact same schedule , but instead of Jacksonville and Miami , they got Indy and New England . WE FUCKING GOT THIS .

Of course.
What did Tibs do to get a T ?
What are you
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
At least she can feel one of your balls .
What I heard was nerf guns , blanket fort , and Saturday morning cartoons .
I'm sorry?
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
This is a case of semantics . However , my take is supported with textual evidence . Your take is speculation and deduction based on said speculation .
Yes, but...
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
This is quite a way for Florida state to kill it 's winning streak .
You're late.
How is the order for crashing , since I 'm assuming not everyone will fit in a party .
Okay , so really not expensive enough to warrant rooting through the dumpster of a large university dining hall on a warm Spring day .
The answer is obviously assembly for a simple MCU . I 'm not even kidding .

After looking at this for several minutes , I can conclusively say that where the hell is Blood of the Martyr .
Make sure he 's not breastfeeding either .
Seems as players we just go around killing all these powerful beings ...
Pardon me?
Yes , it is more niche than icebreaker , but it has to be , because otherwise it 'd be miles better .
Kiss ... gene Simmons seems like a dickwad
River God By Wilbur Smith will whisk you away to another world .
These are the real , hard hitting questions this sub needs to ask . Enough with this Reverse Flash bullshit .
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?
Take care of yourself, Walter.
Yes.
Had a truly delicious breakfast of scrambled eggs , coffee and toast this morning .

Sweet photo . Which band 's shirt is that ?
I mean if there is n't a definite answer then we might as well use that one , there is n't really anything wrong with it .

Are you intelligent?
Any itching recently ? Have you been exposed to anything you are allergic to ?
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
Who is, then?
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
Just reminded me . what happened to the story of all the ISIS fighters turning up to hospital with Ebola ?

Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.

This was the most depressing part because it was Huskar .
It 's less that I refuse , and more that he lives on the West Coast and I live on the East and we ca n't .
We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
I think you should draw it out . Maybe OP made Canada small because of its population . Either way , I would like to wear the pants of this relationship .
This reminded me to go back and finish House of Cards .
It makes me so happy to hear the Run The Jewels instrumental on the NFL playoffs commercial
Why do consoles not have in game chat text ? Maybe be more specific as to the game itself as some games do in fact have in game text chat .
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
Really ? I want to get the game for myself !
Thank you for being so nice .
Wow , Yoshi 's Island got pretty hardcore since I last played it .
This guy is awesome . I 'm glad to hear that we gave him a hand in his rise to the top .

Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
Hello I'm Dr...
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
The efforts of the Greeks to protect their cultural heritage is admirable . I wish that eventually , the Elgin marbles would make their way back home , where they belong .

Why the hell would you do that ?
Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.

Serious question : did anyone on EUNE get it ?
I 'm ocd and all your wires are driving me insane .
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's  your  bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?
I do n't understand how this theory persists . I 've ranked up after one win . It has nothing to do with wins in a row .
Did Diogenes insult Socrates ? I 've read a lot of anecdotes about him harrassing Plato , but never one about Socrates .
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
Eat your mustard.
Now will you get in the flask?
Luckily I happen to have a second console in my office
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
So if we went there we would be dogging ?
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
I read it LOL . But if you ask me that I 'll surely draw you into enough conversation to make you buy artwork off of my online Etsy store . XD
Oh , my point was n't to not charge .
Sure.  It's fine.
If I was stuck in the middle of Siberia I 'd probably want to murder someone too .
hi there! how's life today? please, call me laura. please, tell me your first name
Wow wow wow speechless ... do you speak in any of your videos ? Would love to hear your voice
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
You people are my heroes . I 'm just getting accustomed to surviving Apollo . Congrats
Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world.
Thank-Q!
durarara seems like it has all in there
I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.
I sure as hell hope this is rock bottom .
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
The princess is dead.
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
That chocolate milk came from brown cows ... A true Wisconsinite at heart

His apparent antisemitism will be difficult to reconcile . I recall reading that he disapproved of CS Lewis ' wife primarily because she was a convert from Judaism .
actually she got it after she dumped me so it was nice to have her poor decision making skills reaffirmed
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
You get a translator, Captain?
So how about this Max Domi kid ? Pretty good ?
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
Oh , man ! This sounds delicious ! Would it work well with fried rice ? I do n't like regular rice much . Thank you so much !
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
No wonder he knows so much about ostrich .
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
Ha . Hun , you only need confidence tied with fear . Fear of guns and sharks are okay . Theres is nothing to fear of family and friends .
That shit was lame , so anti climatic . Ca n't even stand and face Cormier . God I hope Cormier smashes that immature , fake , arrogant fuck
The placement of the Miller Lite decal on the boards is enraging .
Rats! I've lost number three.

I do n't get the hate for Watson . The guy is literately batting his heart out despite the conditions being against him and everyone wants him to fail
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.

This is cool , I really like your sound !
A daisy for the lady.
not even going to entertain responding to this , you do n't get it .
Where's Sam?
"Neutralized?" How?
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.
Will you give this letter to Michael.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!

Looks great , be sure to bevel some of those edges too !
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
But I thought Wendy Davis was one of the good ones . But now to hear she is just a run of the mill sleazy politician - shocking .
Five seconds earlier than never is still never .
But wait ... who pressed the camera button ?
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you  going ...?

Arin dying in the water immediately after saying the water ca n't hurt him ? How ironic !
Owning a DSM is a true labor of love . Unfortunately it will never truly love you back .
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.
I'm sorry...

Wow . How did she survive ? Thank you for sharing your post .

Hum ? Who 's saying the woman hired would be less qualified ? The standards can be the same with a different referral bonus .
Do n't forget those crocodiles in the muddy waters .
Are you going to make this hard for me?
I'll be the judge of that.

Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0

Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.

Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.

Variable on the mors is easier to use than the scope on the atlas IMO .
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
Considering I work in a funeral home , I could easily cremate it .
He 's staying until the end of the season at least , then he will go play for a different club .
Don't mention it.
His pistol must of jammed.
Why would you put ophelia behind dilma lol
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when they�re naked.
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
Nice of you... thank you.

Kansas State . They wax asses the right way .
Where does it stand in relation to Big Wank Theory ?
Let 's take a lesson from Canada and make the victims famous rather than the shooter .
Also , using a VPN with steam is never a good idea .
Just hang a minute.
Who?
okay , but what are the percentages for black men that are platonic friends with white women and play video games together with a weird claw grips ?
Caesar, don't.
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
But you were with me.
Huh?
Dude that 's so awesome . Ca n't wait to see the finished product .
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
I would very much like to take pics with you . I 'm a student , but my schedule is pretty flexible . Your photos are beautiful !
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
Reading comments I 'm confused . Are you lesbian , bi , straight , adventurous , or just have a giant sexual gray area ?

Byzantine?
You just did.
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
Because it's the rules!
Ta.
I 'm not going to pretend I 'm smart enough to know what the hell you are showing us here .
When I left here with the money...
Album art or such . I 'll be sure to credit you
Oh the altered history stuff is fun , the characters just get a little repetitive and bland IMO .

I did n't intend to cause all this stress , but misery loves company ! xD
I was referring to the South Park parody of him .
Did you replace the entire pcv system or just one pipe of it ?
Yeah.
Bringing some real substance to the conversation , I see .
You weren't attracted to him at all?

Hi ya, Rebecca...
You're freaking out here man.
And as if to prove my point ...
It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey
What do you mean?
I think this just became recursive ... just like its supposed to be !
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
Did ... did he put in artificial chromatic aberration ? Holy shit , that is an impressive way to add realism . I 've never seen that done before .
Crazy Lee thinks people becoming sane is a crisis .
Have the problems with finding friends been fixed yet ? My friend and I are trying to play together , but it never puts us in the same instance .
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
Much Music was the shit growing up Is it still around ? I remember it going through an MTV phase of no longer playing music .
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.

Durant gon na give Dion a warm coat and some soup .
I think it worked out okay, don�t you?

But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
Darren, we better turn around.
Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.

One to five?
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
No I know that , I meant how do you mean it was deliberately handled incorrectly ?
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
What are you then?
he gave us exact locations where to look .
When did you get back?
I do n't know what I 'm looking at .
Something screams we 're not getting the full story here ...
Has Advil ever contacted you about your handle ?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
How do you get your hair like that btw ?
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
...that's right...
Is he going to see this?
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
Our team likes to draft Silencer Techies . It has no real synergy , except cause fucking misery for the enemy .
The One Where Rick Has A Bad Day
I ca n't get medium quality haha . Brings back the GOM player days .
No , it 's just that the topic is on a group that encourages murder .

Alderman Swayzak.
Astronauts lift . Their equipment is pretty heavy
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
What 's it like being sexually attracted to pans ?
Because it is so hard to look at the comment above mine to understand the context .
if they wo n't call offensive PI or offensive holding , the advantage goes to the Panthers . It will get really ugly very quickly . I 'm sad ...
...touch that.
You 're taking benzos because you do n't like your haircut ? That sounds a little disconcerting to me . Be careful with those things .
I hate her.  I really hate her.
Only a dollar you say ? Wow what a steal !
I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
I assume you have to login to the new Facebook account on the Facebook app .
Same situation here , I do have friends but I ca n't be open because they 'll either laugh at you or just tell everyone .
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
Hey, Ernie!

What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
What?
Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there
Great fake missouri . That 's what I call big balls play calling .
Please. Just one minute of your time.
Why do you believe that ? So many assumptions .
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
LOL The guys interpret the ear bud thing as a sign to talk louder . Unreal !
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...   Raoul ?
Where are we going ?
Oh, no -� it's too delicious! You're making it up!
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
That was something they introduced with Cataclysm , was n't it ? Since the old base game no longer exists , they bundled the expansion with the new one .
Roger, no.
Dudley, what do you want?

And he's fine, girl.

Wierd not sure who would down vote this comment . Lol you were just stating some facts about the schedule haha

What?
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
I don't think I like this.
Who the hell are you?
...When did you know all this?
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
Of course it was , ignore him , he 's a Cowboys fan . He does n't know left from right .

Well , only babies of Evil Alignment , but yes ...
With anything?
life can really suck sometimes ... and there do n't even need to be a reason its just going to be sucky tomorrow

Dear fucking God I 'm an idiot ...

Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
On very long road trips I 'll start singing along to songs in the most stupid ways I can : falsetto , growling , pitch changes . Whatever sounds the silliest .
Is it over if they arrest you now?
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
That 's just stupid , everybody knows that both nip and dignitas would beat Na'Vi any day of the week
I'm hungry.
Three and a half hours?
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
Where are you going?
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
SrA is love . SrA is life .

So that 's what happened to Farva !
Man thats awesome , those are some badass clubs . You 're a lucky man
Probably because mocking race is a bad thing , mocking religion is n't .

There 's also the bit about how the entire area has been destroyed by ... other Christians ... that makes you really think twice if Jesus really loves you .

Ghost peppers are n't the hottest any more . Eat a Carolina Reaper , that 's the hottest now .

Who is Bill Clinton ?
Yeah , Alton has hardly done shit with his channel . Really disappointing .
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
Biased is one thing , not considering other people 's perspectives is another . Implying other people are stupid upon one slight statement is just plain rude .
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.

People say he got screwed over by the safety car , which he was , but he still should have easily won the race despite that .
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
The girls could all use some of what top heavy girl has .
This is bull shit , and you deserve a nice night of vanilla candles and cunnilingus .

How fucking fine is this guy that you put up with this ? Also nothing in your post makes you seem like an independent woman .
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
You have beautiful eyes but you look alarmed !

Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
Due ? ! Does she like it or do it for you ? Shave or wax ?

I know my luck . This is the exact kind of thing that would happen to me
I appreciate the joke but I 'd just like to point out that that whole affair proved to be false .
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
so , when did you first rape someone
oh awesome ! what type of games ? i 'm mostly gaming on my xbox one .
if you 're white and you just said this to a black dude , jesus man , sort out your life
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
Hello, I'm
Your friend is n't in Melbourne , Australia by any chance ? My attempts at googling a local keto friendly dietician did not bare fruit .
Do you think he is guilty in a court of law or guilty based on personal judgement ?
I had a squad of three . I introduced the two and after using me as an excuse to talk to each other theyve started dating and stopped talking to me
What do you mean, thank God?
You sure?
If the government loses why should you pay court cost ? The police should pay the court cost as a penalty to teach them on how to right a ticket .
I just find it hilarious that they would complain about the choices an American magazine intended for American audiences makes .
'That we can currently prove , though there are now indicators ' makes a decent addendum .
Would the opposite be true too ? I need more after that short campaign .
They also do n't have the infrastructure to clear the streets and salt the roads . Us northerners tend to take a lot of that stuff for granted .
I'll be down in a minute
Does it though ? This is n't a skill move .
This is great , do you get any EU players or is it primarily NA ?
Can you imagine what a pain it is to get them on straight every morning , too ? If one goes on slightly crooked ...
Well , yeah oddly , that 's not exactly normal . I feel bad for him though . I wonder how he got burned ; That must 've been hell .
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can
To be fair , the Palestinian taxes were in response to the lawsuit . Would you give money to someone that 's suing you ?
But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
It's just possible she didn't...
For instance, something like this?
Fun fact : Homosexuality was legalized in Brazil before slavery was abolished there .
But it's not the same.
You spit , that 's a firing . You drop it , that 's a firing .
On the bright side the Americans now have the proper resources to publish a book on what not to do during a hockey game .
I really like the way you laid them out for some reason . Looks good .
What are you talking about?
Umm can someone explain to me what happened in the twist ? Who 's the killer ? Is it Anderson or Sarah ? Did Anderson frame Sarah ?
Why did you click on the ability in the witch doctor kill ? Any reason ? Or was it just for style points ?
How's Marcia? She all right?
Pick locks . Be advised that some locks also require a inquisitor perk to open .
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
You don't believe in suicide.
Is everything okay at work?
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
No , it 's a shallow , dull , pretentious film that appeals to stupid people .
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
Lot of Salty Nintendo fans in here ...
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
Haha nah , no baiting , just genuinely curious . I 'll be purchasing a home this home year , but I ca n't afford MoCo from what I can tell .
But we do it to lobsters and crabs .
What happened?
That won�t be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
I see you 're not a firefly fan .
She did blow him on the first date .
You have to watch out for Sandwich University next year , they 've got real potential
You can feel better knowing it 's not true .
What're you doing?
It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
Getting angry and swearing at people is n't going to do you any favours lol .
You are.
Because everyone can understand a bald tire . This sub has a lot of readers who do n't know how to use a left-handed screwdriver .
What color is it?
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
My hood piercing was one of the best decisions I ever made . Barbell , not hoop .
When it comes.
Pull out, goddamnit!
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
Great video ! And now I suddenly wonder about the speed the snowman is blowing , the weight of the snowballs and the random gravity increase on the candy cane .
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
Josh Holmes said they were going to change the button for ground pound or something .
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
I think that 's a human feeling , not necessarily just an INFJ feeling
Yeah that would have been so witty and original .
What does it say?
How's business?
Who the fuck travels two countries for some weed ?
If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.
But, Buzz, you know I never
Although it 's not a country , in Hong Kong they drive on the left , but in the rest of China they drive on the right .
I have been at the library.
Delete Facebook , Hit the Gym , Lawyer up .
If you count Redcoats as military then they have a fair few . Plus all the medieval warfare sets and the many sci-fi warfare sets .
Chip, your ride is here.
libtard ? So you hate liberalism and also the conservative religion of islam ? Like , you hate everything ?
Ha , no . Saskatoon is way to dinky for uber right now .
Well you 're modding ... So it should be easy to get loot . lol .
Guy looks like he is going to fall asleep out there during the national anthem lol
China no longer need a meatshield against SK . SK and China has developed a very close tie over the years .
Hell I 'm white and my friends make jokes about me being a terrorist cause of my Irish background ...
Uh-huh.
Speak English.
What time is it?
A little late comment but is there going to be a group that wants to play Sunday as well ?
Are you just spraying the saline on , or are you using any q-tips or the like ?
Just finished coming back from the post office mailing it to him , next batch I end up collecting I 'll post about and you 've got first dibs .
What?
verna verna verna verna verna verna verna verna verna verna verna verna verna
what do you mean by no native using voice typing ?
And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids
I often stumble over words and sometimes feel like I stutter , which makes me insecure about my speech . Especially in other languages than my native one .
What?
Thanks , I have n't slept lately .
Beth . Nemesis from high school and my boyfriend 's horrible boss are both Beth .
They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?
reply when you 're on , ill add you
We are a team in Georgia . We are always guaranteed a fuck up at least twice a season .
How will I know you?
As someone at the bar , where are you all ? Found going away party , but no Snoo sign
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
Sounds like it could be a black mirror episode .
I got double trouble Pin on Caves once , so it 's definitly possible .
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
Can I sign yours too?
I did n't really know either until I got a female roommate . At first her bag of human hair frightened me , than ... no wait it always frightened me .
Did I miss something or did they really not give us any information ?
you mean a southern yank . The liberals in the north and west love to sign their rights away
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh?
Promise you what?
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
Hello, Bernie.
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
Um... actually, no.  It looks like he shot down one of their gunships...
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
Fuckin deep ball kills us every damn time
Yeah.
You already have the tent?
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
It really does n't happen that often . People do occasionally give stuff away , but they just make a normal post about it .
There 's people with all kinds of backgrounds and there 's also people with none . There 's probably more bjj and wrestling guys than most others though .
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
Since no one has replied yet , I 'll say I 'm willing to make you one . Have a favorite character or vector ?
I 'm laughing like a fucking dumbass at this shit . My fianc is looking at me like I 'm an idiot .
still no takers ... first come first serve , just PM me
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
Man Chicago sounds like a horrible place .
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
President vetoes works bill?
Michael.
This is actually really cool , I 've been messing around with custom stages for practicing things like this too , so I 'll definitely get some use out of this .
When?
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
Yeah it 's as they were riding back . You can almost see the decision in his face .
Did they get over it by now or are they still butthurt ?
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
ZAZ has n't failed to make me laugh yet .
I'd like to begin.
You know what. Who's going to do it.
It 's clearly not working if he needs to drink in his truck at work . It 's a shame that he 's too proud to admit he needs help .
What is the measurement from base to mushroom tip ?
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
He was also found out to have a mental illness years before but kept on the force .
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Dance?
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
How did she know that?
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Bela, are you ready?
Hold me, Don.
There 's no argument , It 's just the Kiwi 's are n't accepting that it 's Aussie !
Maybe you should think about  yourself  for once.  You always let this guy push you round
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
Really ? That 's awesome dude , thanks .
Me too.
Do n't worry guys . Your QB needs to throw a few picks against Auburn to reach his final form . Trust me on this .
Is na lagging or is it just me ?
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
I remember seeing this book in a middle school library and I would read it at least once a week . Great choice !
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
I 'm glad you did n't indulge him in any way .
Two-headed monsters?
Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
I agree that talking to your boss would be the best thing . Showing everyone at work ? That 's asking for a huge workplace feud .
No comment.
Where do we go from here?
A bar that also serves weed , with free pool , cheap beer and cheap weed , with classic rock , indie and punk music
I wasn't saying anything.
Time to play Spam in the can.
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
I'm already dead.
Do you have a function video on this ? I miss my old buckets and have been looking at Alex 's for a while now
yes . how is that almost half of the world ?
Now lets wait for the pokemon collab ...
Shoulda come over to Missouri ; we did n't get shit .
I want you to look at one another...
Have you considered using the platform the way it was intended to be used ?
A competition is a form of comparison .
Use a binary search mechanism using the characters names . They 'll see that optimal play is not actually fun and then give up !
What the hell are these?
You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.
The more map is CT sided , the more important pistol rounds become . On Nuke , two rounds can determine the whole game .
I 'm confused now . Was that a statement or a question and , if so , what are you asking ?
I 'm honestly kinda scared of Akinfenwa . Our defence does n't usually do well with physical strikers
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
Oh, Jim!
DID THE GIANTS ALREADY GET TICKETS TO SEE THE GAME NEXT YEAR ?
Fuck the media who stirred up the Ferguson riots just so they could sell some ads . Hope this joker gets thrown in jail for a few weeks .
Why?
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
You should give him Cicero 's Outfit to wear . He has some amusing commentary on that that I recently discovered .
Tomorrow.
Looks like you 're going to have one hell of an awkward war soon .
You sew very badly.
why not stream the radio as well on tunein and sync it to the video stream ?
Apparently fist of Crota gives one Eris Exp on completion
I 'm not saying language is the cause , I 'm saying it 's a tool .
Ha ! Great minds think alike , I guess . Nice one !
They far enough?
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Well, you know.  It's um...
If he was Sikh or Buddhist , everyone would be on his dick . If he was a proud Christian or Muslim , we just gloss over that .
Yeah, borrowed!
Yes...
Not sure why but something about the lighter blue on the jeans seems off . Black might be better ?
hey hey, i am laverne, do you have name?
Hopefully she does n't strike me down for ranting but ... Aphrodite controls a scary domain .
Hate ? You seem to know my feelings towards the religious better than I , perhaps because you 're making a flawed assumption . Care to try again ?
Any way I could get that picture without the text ? Thats the clearest picture of him I 've seen .
I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers.  At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
those checks might not be there in a recession .
What an utter travesty of a referee job . How do you pick of that other flag then call it on that completely borderline play on the very next drive ?
Remember when we were a defensive team ?
What do you want the kid to say?
Mama, my story.
Back to New York for starters.
What ? I 'm not on the list ?
...But what'd she do?
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery.
cheers , i 'll check it out . owe you one
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
Once ON start winning some SnD they are going to one the scariest teams to play
Surprising how it can go unnoticed this long ... I mean , you would have some serious account imbalance when this happens .
Submit evidence , please , or I 'll be removing this post .
I think it 's safe to say that Kassadin has the title as the most OP champion for the longest time in the history of League of Legends .
I 'd be interested in details . Is this a cash league ? I 'm in Pittsburgh , but I 'd make the trip for the right league .
Yeah I feel since I 've been out of school , I have dumbed down a bit haha . I want to go for business management though .
What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
How about Canada?
i would tell u to get the fuck out of the subway . that shits loud
I think it 's easier to control a monster with a controller .
It is truly funny and sad I read the whole thread just to see if TheJosh ever relented ... happy to report he does not .
Because it's in English?
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
I agree with the development of Brady , but even if he never developed it still helps the organization by preventing NE from totally dominating the division for a decade .
this is the throne of the fedora wearing neckbeard
Really ? Is this some kind of joke ? I love my Hawks , but there are so many more deserving players .
According to NL , you do n't need it .
Brook is up there . But Law had it the worst imo .
Clicked thinking it was a national ESPN writer , just Rodak .
I wonder if calling the timeout that late had anything to do with wanting to see what they 'd do on third down .
If that was how it worked it would n't be 'very rare ' then , would it ?
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office.
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
Would it work?
looks nice and all , shame nothing can be done about the combat and animations D :
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
WTF ? What are you smoking ? Honest question .
Scooters . They 're everywhere and i ca n't see the appeal other than being easy to ride .
Sometimes the best decisions we make , are the most terrifying , at first .
If it 's not a full body pillow , what 's the point ?
Now... I'm in ...
�Mr. Schuyler .
Is this part of some kind of highlight reel by any chance ?
That poor woman.
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.
Just how much free-time do you have ? xD
Let him finish, Charles.
No, I couldn't...
Am I the only one who kind of likes the Padres Camo uniform ? Lol
It 's like watching a drunk moose stumble into a crowd .
Haha I live downtown , so it 's not bad , I swear .
Blacksmithing , because making something with your hands is fucking metal .
IKEA does decent mattresses , and delivers pretty cheap .
I heard OP likes green marker residue on his sheets
That site is annoying . Nice work though
you ok? please, call me krystal
I have a full sleeve tattoo . If I have to get it amputated , will they let me keep the arm ?
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
Maybe she used another name.
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
Where do you live ? I can help you if you live in NYC . I ca n't otherwise .
Great looking dogs . Are both rescues ? The blue is very dark .
Yes ! I get to see her again in July ! How are you today ?
kelli kelli kelli kelli kelli kelli kelli
I'd stake my reputation.
How bizarre!
could always get a high DPI mouse and move it less than an inch ...
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
Kate, listen.
Can't.  Need water.
Grimace at that all you want , but there was a time when you came out of that dick , young lady !
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
The ones they sell at Universal are not . They do sell some beers at a couple of restaurants if that 's what you 're looking for .
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
You have a LOT of empty hangers . And very cute soles , thanks !
How did you know...?
Cool, bro, now listen up...
Have you ever had your heart broken ?
How was it?
If you just look at the thumbnail , it looks like a supercell thunderstorm .
You should definitely account for age in this .
Oh.
What do you have?
This is just one of the many hilarious moments in this series . Good job giffing it !
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
Lived in the area my whole life and always got this question when in the FQ or other tourist areas . It 's just an assumption .
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Has Stephen Drew ever really been the answer anywhere ?
In know it gets said a lot , but it bears repeating - Atlanta are legit . Watching them beat up the clippers was great . Fuck the Clippers !
Andy, stop! I think he can help you -
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
There was a nationwide exodus of juniors leaving to the draft . Prestigious programs are being forced to play freshman because there simply is n't as much depth .
What?  What is it?
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
If it is pre alpha and for testing why are they locking almost everything behind a paywall ?
This is tactically dangerous.
Like you said-she snowballed him.
If you have anxiety , you should seek help . Counselling and possibly medication .
wow holy shit man you have n't heard yet ?
It absolutely does . It shows you do n't have any fucking idea what you are talking about .
Are the players made free agents or what ?
That sounded wrong in the context of balls : P
A back story to that title would be dandy

I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
Haha yes I was . I was sitting up at the top on the other side of the concrete barrier .
What more is there.
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.

I 'm not him , but one reason to accept the government is because their in a gridlock and are not affecting us or our lives .
It looks like they have been helped out already .
My instinct is to help where I can .

Yes . Atheism applies to gods and only gods . How did you enjoy reading our FAQ ?
You 're not getting an MMO that is updated with content and connected with thousands of other players . You 're getting old games here .
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.

Lots of asshole rich kids , lots of variation of people but mostly rich kids
Maybe I 'm just jaded , but I have a hard time seeing this as enforceable , since factory farms pretty much police themselves . Someone please convince me otherwise .

Meh , ca n't say she 's my type of girl , but she 's the biggest thing to come out of UTEP since Ed Hochuli .
Came to my senses.
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.

Paid sick leave?
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
We'd need charges.

Adonis thought your brother�s body�d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn�t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November.

It 's FFG , what were you expecting ?
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
I would literally kill for a job like that .

You know Olivia Munn 's half Chinese , right ? And I 'm assuming Sorkin had taken that into account when Sloan spoke fluent Japanese on air in one episode .
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
